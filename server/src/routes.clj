  "Sketching some enhancement for ruuter routes
   Trying to make the routes map more simple to
   describe routes in one map.

   Before: 
   (def routes [{:path \"/register\"
			              :method :post
			              :response (str \" Posted \" r)}

			             {:path \"/register\"
			              :method :get
			              :response (str \" Get \" r)}

			             {:path \"/list\"
			              :method :get
			              :response (fn [req]
			                          req)}])
   
   After:
   (def ehn-routes [{:path \"/register\"
                  			:methods {:post (fn [r] (str \" Posted \" r))
                            			:get (fn [r] (str \" Get \" r))}}

			                 {:path \"/list\"
			                  :methods {:get (fn [req] req)}}])
   ")

(defn routes-builder [r]
  (vec (for [rt r
             mts (:methods rt)
             :let [k (key mts)]]
         {:path (:path rt)
          :method k
          :response (second mts)})))
